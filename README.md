### square equation

This program solves the square equation. 
Square-equation is equation of view: ax^2 + bx + c = 0;

My program checks 4 situations:
1) Square equation has 2 roots;
2) Square equation has 1 root;
3) Square equation has infinity roots;
4) Square equation hasn't roots.

If you want to solve your 2nd degree polynom, you must input 3 coefficients (a, b, c) before your polynom.
